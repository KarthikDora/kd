            <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
            <p>
              I have been designing, developing websites and mobile applications for close to 7 years now. When i started my career as a college recruit, I was put into Manual testing in a Telecommunications company. This involved watching movies for a living! Well, for the most part. I quickly moved on to Web design and development as a prospect career path to secure a better future.
              Over time I equipped myself with a multitude of skills and kept pursuing the route of continuous education to keep myself up-to-date.  Long story short, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications for my previous firm and have done a lot of small side projects for fun!

          <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
          <p>
            I am a Certified Scrum Master. Taking up the occasional yet additional responsibility in this role has helped me adapt quickly and come closer to mastery in the field of Agility in the Software Development world. This certification taught me the important aspects of a self-disciplined cross-functional TEAM, how to leverage the maximum potential from each individual, their skills, and how to assist others in following this simple methodology to improve your team's results in the longer run.

            <h3>Event Management</h3>
            <p>
              All work and no play makes everyone, well, not them! <br />
              My previous organisation had many groups of people with similar passions who came together formed Employee Resource Groups. I had the privilege of being a part of a group called Diversity Council for 7 years where we brainstormed, created, organised and managed events. Not just that, we raised money for charity and this provided me the avenue of giving back your share to the community. Just the sheer inclusivity of the group and its team members showed their collective passion towards event management and helped create never before seen events with a sense of personalisation to the end participents as well as the event sponsors! Best part was that they were wayyyyyy too much fun!
